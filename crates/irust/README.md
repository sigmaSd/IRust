# IRust
Cross Platform Rust Repl

You can try out IRust with no installation or setup (via Gitpod.io) by visiting https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/sigmaSd/IRust

## Keywords / Tips & Tricks

**:help** => print help, use `:help full` for the full version

**:reset** => reset repl

**:show** => show repl current code (optionally depends on [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) to format output)

**:add** *<dep_list>* => add dependencies also it accepts most `cargo add` arguments, for example you can import local dependencies with `:add --path path_to_crate`

**:type** *\<expression\>* => shows the expression type, example `:type vec!(5)`
  
**:time** *\<expression\>* => return the amount of time the expression took to execute. example: `:time 5+4` `:time my_fun(arg1,arg2)`

**:time_release** *\<expression\>* => same as `time` command but with release mode

**:load** => load a rust file into the repl

**:reload** => reload the last specified file

**:pop** => remove last repl code line

**:del** *<line_num>* => remove a specific line from repl code (line count starts at 1 from the first expression statement)

**:edit** *[editor]* => edit internal buffer using an external editor, example: `:edit micro`. If no editor is specified then the one from the EDITOR environment variable is used (if set). Note some gui terminal requires using `:sync` command after the edit (vscode)

**:sync** sync the changes written after using :edit with a gui editor (vscode) to the repl

**:cd** => change current working directory

**:color** *\<key\>* *\<value\>* => change token highlight color at runtime, for the token list and value representation check the Theme section, exp: `:color function red` `:color macro #ff12ab` `:color reset`

**:toolchain** *\<value\>* => switch between toolchains, supported value are: `stable`, `beta`, `nightly`, `default`

**:theme** *\<value\>* => if used without arguments list currently installed themes, otherwise set irust to the given theme, see Themes section for more info
  
**:check_statements** *true*/*false* => If its set to true, irust will check each statemnt (input that ends with ;) with cargo_check before inserting it to the repl

**:bench** => run `cargo bench`

**:asm** *\<function\>* => shows assembly of the specified function, note that the function needs to be public, and there has to be no free standing statements/expressions (requires [cargo-show-asm](https://github.com/pacak/cargo-show-asm))

**:executor** *\<executor\>* => set the executor to be used by IRust, available options are: `sync` `tokio` `async_std`, by  using an async executor, `await` becomes usable with no other modifications for async executors)

**:evaluator** *\<evaluator>\>* => set the evaluator statement, exmaple: `:evaluator println!("{}",{$$})` the `$$`
 will be replaced by IRust by the input code (the default evaluator uses debug formatting). To reset the evaluator to default you can use `:evaluator reset`
 
**:scripts:** => if invoked with no arguments it prints a list of detected scripts, if invoked with on argument it print that script info if it exits, if invoked with 2 arguments, it tries to activate/deactivate a script, example: `:scripts Vim deactivate`

**:compile_time** *\<on/off\>* => if set to on, IRust will print compiling time on each input, compile time includes rustc compiling + some IRust code (should be marginal)

**:compile_mode** *\<debug/release\>* => Sets how cargo will compile the code in release or debug mode

**:main_result** *\<value\>* => Change main result type, available options are `Unit` and `Result` (which is Result\<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error\>\>), Using `Result` as type allows to use `?` in the repl without any boilerplate

**:dbg** *\<expression\>* => Spawn rust-lldb/rust-gdb with (an optional expression), example: `:dbg` or `:dbg fact(12)`, The debugger can be specified in the config file

**:expand** *\[function\]* => Shows the result of macro expansion, requires https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand, function is optional, example `fn b() { println!("42"); }` then `:expand b`

**:exit** | **:quit** => Exit IRust immediately

**$$** => Shell commands can be interpolated with rust code with '$$', for example: `let a = $$ls -l$$;`, this feature can be [en/dis]abled via the config file

**::** => run a shell command, example `::ls`

You can use arrow keys to cycle through commands history.

You can disable all colors by setting `NO_COLOR` env variable.

To enable completion with tab via rust-analyzer, set `enable_rust_analyzer` to true in the config.

## Keybindings

**ctrl-l** clear screen

**ctrl-c** clear line

**ctrl-d** exit if buffer is empty

**ctrl-z** [unix only]  send IRust to the background

**ctrl-r** search history, hitting **ctrl-r** again continues searching the history backward, hitting **ctrl-s** searches the history forward

**ctrl-left/right** jump through words

**HOME/END** go to line start / line end

**Tab/ShiftTab** cycle through completion suggestions

**Alt-Enter | ctrl-s** add line break

**ctrl-e** force evaluation

**ctrl-o**->**[+-]key** Start recording a macro and saved on the specified key, if **ctrl-o** is clicked again the recording is stopped

**ctrl-p**->**key** Play a macro saved on the specified key

**ctrl-u** Undo

**ctrl-y** Redo

**ctrl-x** Delete current line

## Cli commands

**--help** prints help message

**--reset-config** reset IRust configuration to default

If input is piped to IRust then it will evaluate it and exit, example: `echo '"hello".chars()' | irust`

## Configuration

IRust config file is located in:

**Linux**: */home/$USER/.config/irust/config.toml*

**Win**: *C:\Users\\$USER\AppData\Roaming/irust/config.toml*

**Mac**: */Users/$USER/Library/Preferences/irust/config.toml*

*default config:*
```toml
  # history
  add_irust_cmd_to_history = true
  add_shell_cmd_to_history = false

  # colors
  ok_color = "Blue"
  eval_color = "White"
  irust_color = "DarkBlue"
  irust_warn_color = "Cyan"

  shell_interpolate = true
  local_server = false
  local_server_adress = "127.0.0.1:9000"
  theme = "default"
```

## Theme
Since release `1.66.0` `IRust` can now parse any theme file located under `$config_dir/irust/themes` and use it for the highlighting colors.

To select a theme, set its name in the irust config. for example to set `themes/mytheme.toml` set `theme = "mytheme"`

Colors can be specified as names ("red") or as hex representation ("#ff12ab").

Default theme file (default.toml):

```toml
  keyword = "magenta"
  keyword2 = "dark_red"
  function = "blue"
  type = "cyan"
  symbol = "red"
  macro = "dark_yellow"
  literal = "yellow"
  lifetime = "dark_magenta"
  comment = "dark_grey"
  const = "dark_green"
  ident = "white"
```

## Prelude
IRust automatically creates `irust_prelude` crate at `xdg_data_dir/irust/irust_prelude`, this crate is imported at startup, any changes to it (that are marked with `pub`) will be immediately reflected on the repl after saving.

## Scripts
IRust supports scripting, all over the code base there are hooks that scripts can react to and usually answer back to IRust with a command.\
Check out [SCRIPTS.md](https://github.com/sigmaSd/IRust/blob/master/SCRIPTS.md) for more info.

## Vim Plugin
For nvim you can use https://github.com/hkupty/iron.nvim (needs irust 1.67.4)

**Old method:**

Since version `1.60.0` IRust supports spawning a local server, by changing `local_server` to `true` in the configuration file.\
This allows it to be controlled programmatically, which in turns allows writing vim plugins that uses this, see https://github.com/sigmaSd/irust-vim-plugin

## Jupyter Notebook
A Jupyter Kernel is available, see https://github.com/sigmaSd/IRust/blob/master/crates/irust_repl/README.md#jupyter-kernel for instructions

## Book
`The IRust Book` is intended to document a couple of tips and tricks https://sigmasd.github.io/irust_book

## Install

- `cargo install irust`
- `cargo binstall irust` (using [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall))

## How It Works (random drawing ahead)

## FAQ

**1- I want to hack on irust but `dbg!` overlaps with the output!!**

Personaly I do this:
- Run 2 terminals side by side
- run `tty` in the first which should output something like `/dev/pts/4`
- run `cargo r 2>/dev/pts4` in the second

Now the `dbg!` statements are printed on the second terminal and the output in the first terminal is not messed up.
